Permission allocation in server       - [x]  done, was quite easy
Remote Programming of Arduino         - [x]  done, using pyfirmata, might try and solve this again if I have time
Configuration of the Servo Driver     - []   
Skills required for Bare Metal Coding of the STM series to reduce unwanted code, to make sure I can remotely program it without any external drivers (I'm not going to use any >:( ) - [x]  done, never knew it was quite easy, but Assembly man jeez
Properly learn ARM Assembly ;_;       - [] 
UART Comms from one STM to another    - []
I2C Comms from one STM to another     - []
SPI Comms from one STM to another     - []
Loading a file into STM               - []
PWM Signal Generation in STM          - []
. . .
There are an endless amounts of things I have to do for this, but for now this is all I want to try and do, one of them being recording video/audio data as spatial memory data, data fusion, and a bunch of other doohickey stuff
